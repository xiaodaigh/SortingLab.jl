**TL;DR**
My (unoptimized) interned string sorting in Julia is on par or faster than R's.

# Interned String Sorting
Another holiday in Australia, another round of playing around with string sorting. This time I have been playing around with [InternedStrings.jl](https://github.com/oxinabox/InternedStrings.jl), which implements a form of string interning. R's data.table exploited R's string interning to make string sorting fast. So I wanted to see if Julia can receive a similar speedup using interned strings. 

## Pseudo-code
This is my high-level **pseudo code** for faster interned string sort

1. Let `pool` be the hashtable (or whatever data structure) that stores all the unique strings
2. Create a data-structure, `pool_fast_lookup`, based on `pool` such that it's easy to look up a string and its rank, e.g. a sorted vector of the unique strings
3. Let `svec` be the vector you wish to sort; for each element of `svec` look up its rank in `pool_fast_lookup` and keep a count in a vector, `cnts`, of how many of each rank there are i.e. create a histogram of the rank
4. generate a vector that repeats the `i`th ranked unique string `cnts[i]` times

Of course step 4 is a little bit of a cheat but if you need to sort something else along with `svec` then you can turn step 4 into an rearrangement algorithms easily.

The reason why this sort might be faster is because sorting is expensive and in this algorithm we only need to sort the unique strings. 

## Issues
Overall I feel something is off and I can't really put my finger on it. I think the results are not entirely accurate. The timings I get by running the code fives times manually, look very different to when I just run it in the REPL in a normal data-workflow.

The above pseudo-code seems quite easy to implement, but I found that step 3 is really slow to do if you use sorted-string vector as `pool_fast_lookup`. E.g. `searchedsortedfirst(x, y)` is slow for sorted a vector of strings `x`. So I have used its pointer to do the looked up which is much faster; but requires an additional step to make the sorted pointed back to strings. This pointer-to-string overhead can really slow down the algorithm; and part of the reason why for shorter length strings a strainght radix sort is faster.

Also I found creating `Vector{InternedString}` to be really slow so I have decided to return a `Vector{String}`. Another issue I noticed is that if for some reason Julia decides not to gc during my run then the code is 2x faster than R. But more often than not it will try to gc which results in significant porpotion of time spent in gc; but this could be because my algorithms aren't optimized and it is creating lots of vectors that's only used once and thrown away.

I had to include R's gc time into the timing so as to give a realistic picture of the time it takes from a user perspective. R is tricky in that if you time its sort it will return quickly. But if you try to do something as simple as `2+2` right after it will spend a signiciant amount of time in gc, so I have decided to keep the elapsed time of the sort plus `2+2` in R to include the gc time, or R might have a small advantage there, given it's less unfront with gc. For data manipulation, from a user perspective, the time it takes until I can issue the next command is key

Overall, the interned string sort is "on par" with R in terms of speed. But the straight radix sort is also quite fast.

## What can improve things?
Faster string comparision will massively improve the speed, as I can just use the pseudo-code version without resorting to comparing pointers for speed.
